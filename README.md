# vue3-material
A collection of vue material components (https://github.com/vuematerial/vue-material) converted to vue3


This is a collection of components derived from vue material ( a material library stuck at vue2 ) converted to vue3, i wanted to embed them directly in my project so i did not used the common library npm pattern, no npm install is required.
All you need to do is to copy the folder and add in to your project then require components as you would normally do with your custom components.
If you see App.vue there are examples of how to use buttons, tooltips etc...
